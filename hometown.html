                <h3>The Origin of the Name Tulungagung</h3>
                <p>There are two versions of the origin of the name Tulungagung. First, Tulungagung is taken from the word 'Pitulungan Agung', which means Help from the Almighty. The name was taken from an incident of Joko Baru who tried to dry up a water source in Ngrowo (the name of Tulungagung Regency in ancient times). Joko Baru blocked the water source using a stick from an enau tree. He is said to have become a snake due to being cursed by his father. To return to being human, Joko had to coil his body around Mount Wilis. However, it turned out that his body could not coil around the mountain perfectly. As a result, he stuck out his tongue to reach it. His father thwarted his efforts by cutting Joko Baru's tongue. Instead of being cut off, the tongue turned into a magical spear. Now, the spear is believed to be still well maintained. The second version states that the name Tulungagung is derived from two words, namely Tulung and Agung. Tulung means source, while Agung means large. In Javanese, Tulungagung can be interpreted as an area that has a large water source. This is because before the Niyama Dam was built by the Japanese army, Tulungagung was often inundated due to the large number of water sources. On the other hand, there is an etymology based on the naming of the capital city of Tulungagung. At that time, the capital city of Tulungagung was in the Kalambret area, which was named the Ngrowo Duchy (the name 'Ngrowo' means water source).</p>
